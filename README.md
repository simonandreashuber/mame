# Modular Arithmetic with Multiple Exponents

### about
This originates from a school project, where we had to find prime factors of a huge number written with multible exponents. In [this repository](https://github.com/simonandreashuber/mame) you can just find the tools I created to solve my task. I use these tools in the [Pool_Zahlentheorie_Aufgabe_20](https://github.com/simonandreashuber/Pool_Zahlentheorie_Aufgabe_20) repository, there you can find example code.

### usage

```C++
//create:
ime reileen({2,3,7}); //2^3^7

//calculate:
reileen % 1999;
reileen.mod(1999);
```
