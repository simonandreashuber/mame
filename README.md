# Modular Arithmetic with Multiple Exponents

### about
This originates from a school project, where we had to find prime factors of a huge number written with multible exponents. I thougth writing code which would work for all numbers with multible exponents, would be a usefull thing.

### usage
create an ```ime``` (Integer with Multible Exponents) like this: ```ime example({2,3,7});``` or give the constructor a ```std::vector<unsigned long long int>```. (example = 2^3^7)

calculate mod like this: ```example % 1999``` or ```example.mod(1999)```.
