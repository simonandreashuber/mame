# Modular Arithmetic with Multiple Exponents

### about
In this repository you can find the tools to do modular arithmetics with numbers written as multible exponents, where it would be infeasible to calculate the result with conventional methods.

### usage

```C++
//create:
ime reileen({2,3,7}); //2^3^7

//calculate:
reileen % 1999;
reileen.mod(1999);
```
