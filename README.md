# Modular Arithmetic with Multiple Exponents

### about
This originates from a school project, where we had to find prime factors of a huge number written with multible exponents. In [this repository](https://github.com/simonandreashuber/mame) you can just find the tools I created to solve my task. I use these tools in the [Pool_Zahlentheorie_Aufgabe_20](https://github.com/simonandreashuber/Pool_Zahlentheorie_Aufgabe_20) repository, there you can find some example code.

### usage
create an ```ime``` (Integer with Multible Exponents) like this: ```ime example({2,3,7});```. (example = 2^3^7)

calculate mod like this: ```example % 1999``` or ```example.mod(1999)```.
