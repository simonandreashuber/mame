## Modular Arithmetic with Multiple Exponents
---

### about
This originates from a school project, where we had to find prime factors of a huge number written with multible exponents. I thougth writing code which would work for all numbers with multible exponents, would be a usefull thing.

### usage
Create an ```ime``` (Integer with Multible Exponents) like this: ```ime example({2,3,7});``` or give the constructor a ```std::vector<unsigned long long int>```.
